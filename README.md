# Book Recommendation System

This project is a Book Recommendation System developed using Machine Learning and Python. The system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend books to users based on their preferences and past interactions. The project includes data processing, model development, and visualization of the types of books recommended more often and the ratio of people recommending them.

## Features
- Recommends books based on user preferences and past interactions.
- Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques.
- Analyzes and visualizes the types of books recommended more often and the ratio of people recommending them.
